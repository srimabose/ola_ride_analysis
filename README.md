# 🚕 Ola End-to-End Ride Analytics Project | Power BI + SQL + DAX + Excel

A business intelligence case study that dives deep into 100,000+ rows of ride-booking data from Ola, designed to model real-world operational problems in the ride-sharing industry.  
This end-to-end data analytics solution uses a full modern BI stack — from raw CSV ingestion to powerful interactive dashboards — to deliver actionable insights and enterprise-level decision support.

## 🧭 Objective

To build a fully interactive Power BI dashboard using real-world business logic, advanced DAX measures, SQL preprocessing, and Power Query ETL that can:

- Assist operations teams in identifying cancellation trends and their root causes  
- Help product & CX teams analyze ratings, customer loyalty, and ride completion  
- Enable leadership to monitor ride economics across vehicle types and payment modes  
- Serve as a scalable foundation for further machine learning, churn analysis, or cohort modeling

## 🧠 Key Insights Delivered

- 🔻 Cancellation diagnostics (by customer vs. driver, with reason analysis)  
- 🚗 Vehicle type performance (ratings, distances, booking value)  
- 📈 Ride value segmentation by status, distance, and location  
- 🌐 Payment channel effectiveness (UPI, card, cash)  
- ⭐ Driver & customer rating patterns across segments  
- 🛑 Incomplete rides and associated business risk tags
